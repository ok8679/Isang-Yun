# Introduction
Isang Yun, a Korean born composer who was expelled to Germany, was one of the “56 important composers in the 20th century” and “top five composers alive in Europe.” Influenced by Schönberg, Yun invented his unique musical technique, which compared him with the likes of Messiaen, Ligetti, and Penderecki. His reputation was built upon his musical ability to “perfectly expresses the Eastern philosophy and musical techniques in Western musical language.” Most critiques found his music one of a kind as it is “East Asian combined with Western, traditional combined with international, and still Korean in essence.” 

Yet, Yun himself consistently highlighted that his music is an attempt to bring Eastern musical knowledge and aesthetic to the West. Scholarly work regarding Yun’s music and critiques have centered around how he is “Asian” who has composed Western music. However, by only focusing on his Eastern-ness or Western-ness, binary understandings of his music remain in the conventional analysis of music historiography that highlights the dichotomous discourse of West versus East. Eventually, understanding Yun’s music in the binary frame reinforces and prioritizes the Eurocentric perspective and history, while placing Eastern composers in the peripheries. Moreover, this analysis neglects permeability of cross-cultural contacts that Yun highlighted.

How can we decipher this long-standing history of centering European music? This paper attempts to decentralize European music by subverting a fixed belief that European music has had a one-sided impact since modernization. In contrast to the conventional understanding that Isang Yun’s music was in between the/was an amalgamation of the East and West  , this paper understands his music as fluid which is not confined to both East and West. In order to deliver this, the movements and networks he acted upon which impacted his life and any aesthetic changes will be discussed. His philosophical belief, musical language, and life transitions were reflected in his music, so his music will be explored in order to understand his fluidity more accurately/precisely. By doing this, this paper urges to reconstruct the geographic and spatial meanings of music.

# Life

## Tongyeong, Joseon

Tongyeong is a seaport city in Namhae, South Korea. As a peninsula, Tongyeong was a center of the maritime trade, connected to other cities such as Busan, Yeosu, and even Japan. Accordingly, Tongyeong has a rich history of diversity, known as an intersectional city of the culture of Confucianism but also ordinary citizens, locals and foreigners. As a result of this diversity, people in Tongyeong had the opportunity to be exposed to different cultures as well as have national consciousness and pride. Moreover, the city is known for its history of admiring/praising Lee Sun Shin, who is regarded as the greatest naval commander in Korean history. He achieved tremendous victories against the Japanese invasion during the Joseon Dynasty. Yun lived in Tongyeong during the colonial period, where he was exposed to Western music and traditional music from an early age. Moreso, surrounded by many independence activists in his hometown, he became a nationalist from young.

## Osaka, Japan

From 1920 to 1930s, Imperial Japan shifted its ruling strategy from military rule to cultural rule, allowing Korean students to experience Western and Japanese culture. Korean students who wanted to study European music either travelled to Japan or Germany, and Isang Yun decided to go to Japan to pursue his studies. Yun lied to his father that he would be studying at a business school and went to Japan with 20won, approximately enough to buy a bag of rice.  Living in Ikaino, he attended the Osaka Conservatory in 1935. Ikaino (now referred to as Ikuno-ku), was known for the large population of Zainichi Koreans living in Osaka. It was an industrial area, close to the national military factory. This area required cheap laborers, which forced more Koreans in the 1920s to migrate to Ikaino during the colonization period, establishing the area as one of the largest Korean populated areas.

## Tongyeong, Joseon

Yun had to return to Tongyeong as soon as possible since the mother passed away. <암흑속에서 노래하다> Back in Tongyeong, he started to work as a teacher for a family living. During this time, Imperial Japan turned to ethnocide policy. Hwayang elementary school, where Yun served as a teacher, was known for its national consciousness. He secretly taught in Korean to students and released his first children’s song book, “Songs for Cowboy. 목공을 위한 노래”

## Tokyo, Japan

In 1939, he went to Japan again. This time, he went to Tokyo National University of Fine Arts in order to learn from Tomojirō Ikenouchi 池内友次郎. Tomojirō Ikenouchi was a composer who studied in France, influenced by French impressionism. Ikenouchi was known for his music that incorporated Japanese traditional scales in classical music. It was reported that applying Japanese scales with Western music was first discovered in Tokyo National University of Fine Arts in 1932.  While studying in Tokyo, Yun had to deal with struggles living as a Korean student in Japan. This school required students to participate in the military training during the 1930s. 
What was the significance of Yun attending an Imperial Japanese school as an independence activist just because of his love in music? At that time, the ethnocide policy had been strengthened. Koreans were forced to legally change their Korean name to a Japanese name. The Sino-Japanese war occurred which caused serious economic damage to Japan. Japan conquered Indochina, and other Asian countries in order to compensate their loss of economy. During this era, the Korean peninsula became a base for military supplies. Koreans were forced to do labor, serving at military or military factories. Accordingly, Yun was financially struggling, he had to work during the daytime and compose at night. He was able to navigate his life during this tumultuous time thanks to the painting of The Four Guardian Deities in Goguryeo Murals.  He put the painting on the desk wall, in order to remind himself of nationalism/in order to admire nationalism. Moreso, Yun joined in Zainichi Korean underground organization for the independence movement while composing “Cello concerto.”

## Tongyeong, Joseon

2 years later, the tension between Japan and America intensified right before the Pacific war, so he had to return to Korea. At that time, Koreans who returned from Japan were watched, and Yun was among one of them. He organized Tongyeong the underground organization against the Japanese Empire. This organization was dismantled because a spy reported it/disclosed their secret, and Yun had to join the Imperial Japanese military. He was forced to deprive Koreans of their rice produce and send it to Imperial Japan instead. Imperial Japan implemented “The Rice Production Development Program 産米增殖計劃” in 1920, which was planning to increase rice supply. This included a strategy of making Korea the land of breadbasket in order to prioritize Japan’s rice demand. Colonized Korea supplied 98% of rice imports to Japan. Despite strict orders, Yun was imprisoned with other independence activists due to their hesitations to deprive Koreans of rice. After their release, Yun once again formed an underground organization for Independence, and because of this, he had to escape to Gyeong-Seong (a Sino name of Seoul used during the colonization) with his cello.

## Seoul, Korea
When Korea achieved independence from Japan/when Korea declared independence from Japan, Yun was in Gyeong-seong in 1945. In contrast to Koreans’ hope that Korea will be unified after the independence, Gyeong-seong was an area of conflicts. Parties were fighting against different ideologies; Southern Korea was occupied by the US while Northern Korea was occupied by the Soviet Union. Even though Yun himself joined the communist party, he criticized these conflicts as “politics after Independence were barbaric”  and left Gyeong-seong, heading to Tongyeong.

## Tongyeong, Korea
In Tongyeong, he organized Tongyeong Culture Foundation 사진잇음. He established an orphanage for war orphans. In 1948, he began to work as a teacher at Tongyeong Girls’ Highschool, composing 9 school songs in Korean in order to remove Japanese influence in schools. During the Korean War, he composed the Korean war song, <낙동강>. Moreover, he was a member of the Korean Composer Association, serving as a critic while composing music and preparing for his studies abroad.

## Paris, France
France was the first European country Isang Yun studied in. Even though Yun’s music was highly influenced by twelve-tone music, which was famous for German composers, he was unable to join the German classical music scene. This was because it was hard for international students to study in a European country unless they had social networks within the country. Fortunately, he had a friend who had studied in France, and with his reference, Yun was able to study in France.  He attended Paris Conservatoire, being taught by Tony Aubin and Pierre Revel. He did not enjoy his teachers’ musical focus as it mostly centered around classical music only from the classic era.

## West Berlin, Germany
Yun studied at Musikhochschule Berlin under Boris Blacher. Yun served as a representative in the student council, organizing an ethnic art troupe that traveled and performed music. At Internationale Ferienkurse fur Neue Musik Darmstadt, Yun was shocked by John Cage’s 4’ 33’’. Since then, he started to become heavily influenced by avant garde music, escaping from twelve-tone music. As a result, during this time, Yun’s important technique, Haupttontechnik (main-note technique), was influenced by Sigimsae 시김새, a Korean understanding of the pitch. 
In the 1960s, South Korean students who lived in West Berlin were not restricted to cross over to East Berlin. The North Korean Embassy in East Berlin offered food often since North Korea was more prosperous than South Korea. This made South Korean students organized dinners at the North Korean Embassy, which consequently led to disaster/havoc. Moreover, there was no surveillance for this activity in Berlin from South Korea; indeed, South Korean students were not forbidden to cross over the border.

## Pyongyang, North Korea
Yun Isang had a best friend, Sanghan Choi, who studied music and worked as an independence activist who eventually went to North Korea after the Korean War. Yun always desired to meet his friend again which made him contact the North Korean Embassy located in Germany. The North Korean Embassy invited Yun to North Korea, and Yun accepted it in order to meet his old friend and see The Four Guardian Deities in Goguryeo Murals in person.  When he went to Pyeongyang, he had to have interviews with North Korean leaders, which eventually was problematic for him in the future. Yun was greatly inspired by The Four Guardian Deities in Goguryeo Murals, which drove his decision to compose orchestra <영상>

## Seoul, Korea
On July 8, 1967, The Dongbaekrim Incident or the East Berlin Incident (東伯林事件) brought a political scandal throughout South Korea. At that time, the Central Intelligence Agency claimed that Koreans who lived in Germany and France had gone to North Korea to be trained as North Korean spies. Yun was also included in this incident, kidnapped by the Central Intelligence Agency. His travel to North Korea proved to be troublesome and they detained him in prison. Yun’s imprisonment shocked the German society, making German people protest against the South Korean government. Spiegel, a German magazine interviewed Yun in prison, and this propelled music organizations in Germany to petition for the South Korean government to release Yun. 
Musica Viva was one of them; they sent a letter including Wolfgang Fortner (a head of the Musica Viva) and the Mayor of Berlin. Yun joined in Freie Akademie der Künste Hamburg in May 1968, in order to demand his release, which made this incident more famous in Germany. Wilhelm Maler, a head of this organization sent a protest letter which included a sign of Karlheinz Stockhausen, György Ligeti, etc. “Isang Yun is the most prominent composer not only in Europe but also in the world. His purpose was always to bring the excellent elements of Korean music into Western music….International music field needs Isang Yun.”
