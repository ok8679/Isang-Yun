## Tongyeong, Joseon

2 years later, the tension between Japan and America got intense, so he had to return to Korea. At that time, Koreans who returned from Japan were watched, and Yun was among them.

Imperial Japan implemented “The Rice Production Development Program 産米增殖計劃” since 1920, which was planning to increase rice supply. This included a strategy of making Korea as a land of breadbasket. Colonized Korea supplied 98% rice imports to Japan. Yun was imprisoned with other independence activists due to his hesitation when depriving Koreans’ rice.
